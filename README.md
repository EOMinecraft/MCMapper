Compiling for Mac OS X
======================

You should be able to open the Xcode project and click Build, you will then find your executable in the Build/Release folder.


Compiling for Linux
===================

Nothing special is required, just GCC.

To build from source, you should be able to just type `make` in the source folder and all should be good, you will find your executable in the same directory as the makefile.
